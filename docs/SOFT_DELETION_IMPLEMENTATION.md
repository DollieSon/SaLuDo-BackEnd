# Soft Deletion Implementation Summary

## Overview
Soft deletion has been implemented for skills (both job skills and candidate skills), education, and experience. This allows items to be marked as deleted without permanently removing them from the database, enabling recovery if needed.

## Changes Made

### 1. Model Updates

#### Education Model (`Models/Education.ts`)
- Added `isDeleted: boolean` property with default value `false`
- Updated constructor to accept optional `isDeleted` parameter
- Updated `fromObject` and `toObject` methods to handle the new field
- Updated `EducationData` interface to include `isDeleted`

#### Experience Model (`Models/Experience.ts`)
- Added `isDeleted: boolean` property with default value `false`
- Updated constructor to accept optional `isDeleted` parameter
- Updated `fromObject` and `toObject` methods to handle the new field
- Updated `ExperienceData` interface to include `isDeleted`

#### Skill Model (`Models/Skill.ts`)
- Added `isDeleted: boolean` property with default value `false`
- Updated constructor and `create` method to accept optional `isDeleted` parameter
- Updated `fromObject` and `toObject` methods to handle the new field
- Updated `SkillData` interface to include `isDeleted`

#### Job Model (`Models/Job.ts`)
- Updated `JobSkillRequirement` interface to include optional `isDeleted` field
- Added new methods:
  - `softDeleteSkill(skillId)` - Marks a job skill as deleted
  - `restoreSkill(skillId)` - Restores a soft deleted job skill
  - `getActiveSkills()` - Returns only non-deleted skills
- Updated existing methods to consider soft deletion:
  - `hasSkill()` now checks for non-deleted skills only
  - `getSkillRequiredLevel()` and `getSkillsCount()` use active skills
  - `addSkill()` marks skills as not deleted when adding

### 2. Service Updates

#### EducationService (`services/EducationService.ts`)
- **Modified `deleteEducation()`**: Now performs soft deletion by setting `isDeleted = true`
- **Added `restoreEducation()`**: Restores soft deleted education by setting `isDeleted = false`
- **Added `hardDeleteEducation()`**: Permanently removes education from database
- **Updated `getEducation()`**: Added `includeDeleted` parameter (default: false) to filter out soft deleted items

#### ExperienceService (`services/ExperienceService.ts`)
- **Modified `deleteExperience()`**: Now performs soft deletion by setting `isDeleted = true`
- **Added `restoreExperience()`**: Restores soft deleted experience by setting `isDeleted = false`
- **Added `hardDeleteExperience()`**: Permanently removes experience from database
- **Updated `getExperience()`**: Added `includeDeleted` parameter (default: false) to filter out soft deleted items

#### SkillService (`services/SkillService.ts`)
- **Modified `deleteSkill()`**: Now performs soft deletion by setting `isDeleted = true`
- **Added `restoreSkill()`**: Restores soft deleted skill by setting `isDeleted = false`
- **Added `hardDeleteSkill()`**: Permanently removes skill from database
- **Updated `getSkills()`**: Added `includeDeleted` parameter (default: false) to filter out soft deleted items

#### JobService (`services/JobService.ts`)
- **Modified `removeSkillFromJob()`**: Now performs soft deletion using `softDeleteSkill()`
- **Added `restoreSkillToJob()`**: Restores soft deleted job skill using `restoreSkill()`
- **Added `hardRemoveSkillFromJob()`**: Permanently removes job skill using existing `removeSkill()`
- **Added `getJobActiveSkills()`**: Returns only active (non-deleted) job skills

### 3. Route Updates

#### Education Routes (`routes/education.ts`)
- **Updated DELETE `/:candidateId/education/:eduId`**: Now performs soft deletion
- **Added PATCH `/:candidateId/education/:eduId/restore`**: Restores soft deleted education
- **Added DELETE `/:candidateId/education/:eduId/hard`**: Permanently deletes education

#### Experience Routes (`routes/experience.ts`)
- **Updated DELETE `/:candidateId/experience/:expId`**: Now performs soft deletion
- **Added PATCH `/:candidateId/experience/:expId/restore`**: Restores soft deleted experience
- **Added DELETE `/:candidateId/experience/:expId/hard`**: Permanently deletes experience

#### Skills Routes (`routes/skills.ts`)
- **Updated DELETE `/:candidateId/skills/:candidateSkillId`**: Now performs soft deletion
- **Added PATCH `/:candidateId/skills/:candidateSkillId/restore`**: Restores soft deleted skill
- **Added DELETE `/:candidateId/skills/:candidateSkillId/hard`**: Permanently deletes skill

#### Job Routes (`routes/job.ts`)
- **Updated DELETE `/:id/skills/:skillId`**: Now performs soft deletion
- **Added PATCH `/:id/skills/:skillId/restore`**: Restores soft deleted job skill
- **Added DELETE `/:id/skills/:skillId/hard`**: Permanently removes job skill
- **Added GET `/:id/skills/active`**: Gets active (non-deleted) job skills

## API Endpoints Summary

### Education
- `DELETE /api/candidates/:candidateId/education/:eduId` - Soft delete education
- `PATCH /api/candidates/:candidateId/education/:eduId/restore` - Restore education
- `DELETE /api/candidates/:candidateId/education/:eduId/hard` - Hard delete education

### Experience
- `DELETE /api/candidates/:candidateId/experience/:expId` - Soft delete experience
- `PATCH /api/candidates/:candidateId/experience/:expId/restore` - Restore experience
- `DELETE /api/candidates/:candidateId/experience/:expId/hard` - Hard delete experience

### Skills (Candidate)
- `DELETE /api/skills/:candidateId/skills/:candidateSkillId` - Soft delete skill
- `PATCH /api/skills/:candidateId/skills/:candidateSkillId/restore` - Restore skill
- `DELETE /api/skills/:candidateId/skills/:candidateSkillId/hard` - Hard delete skill

### Skills (Job)
- `DELETE /api/jobs/:id/skills/:skillId` - Soft delete job skill
- `PATCH /api/jobs/:id/skills/:skillId/restore` - Restore job skill
- `DELETE /api/jobs/:id/skills/:skillId/hard` - Hard delete job skill
- `GET /api/jobs/:id/skills/active` - Get active job skills

## Backward Compatibility

The implementation maintains backward compatibility:
- Existing GET endpoints return only active (non-deleted) items by default
- The `isDeleted` field defaults to `false` for all new items
- Existing data without the `isDeleted` field will be treated as `false` (active)

## Usage Notes

1. **Default Behavior**: All GET endpoints now return only active (non-deleted) items by default
2. **Including Deleted Items**: Some service methods accept an `includeDeleted` parameter to retrieve all items
3. **Three Deletion Levels**:
   - **Soft Delete**: Marks as deleted but keeps in database (default DELETE endpoints)
   - **Restore**: Unmarks deleted items (new PATCH restore endpoints)
   - **Hard Delete**: Permanently removes from database (new hard DELETE endpoints)

## Database Migration

For existing data, the `isDeleted` field will be treated as `false` (active) when missing. No database migration is strictly required, but you may want to add the field to existing documents with a default value of `false`.

## Testing

All existing functionality should continue to work as before, but now with the ability to recover accidentally deleted items. Test the new endpoints to ensure soft deletion, restoration, and hard deletion work as expected.
